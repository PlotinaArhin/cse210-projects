We are working on an open-ended project to develop a Task Manager application. 
The Task Manager will allow users to organize and track their tasks efficiently. 
So far, we have completed the initial design phase, including identifying the main classes such as Task, User, and TaskList. 
We have also outlined the key behaviors each class will need to support, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and displaying task lists. 
Additionally, we have created empty shells for these classes and methods to lay the foundation for the implementation phase. 
Our program currently runs without compile errors, although it lacks meaningful interaction as we are still in the early stages of development. 
Our next steps will involve fleshing out the methods for each class and implementing the user interface to provide a functional Task Manager application.
